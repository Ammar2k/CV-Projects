# CV Projects

This repository contains some computer vision projects that I have done using Python and OpenCV. These projects are not written from scratch but are based on existing code or tutorials with some modifications or improvements.

## Projects

- Highway Lane Detection: This project uses edge detection and masking techniques to detect and draw the highway lanes from a video stream of a camera mounted on a car.
- LeNet Implementation: This project implements the LeNet convolutional neural network architecture and trains it on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- Traffic Sign Classification: This project uses a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs from images captured by a camera.

## Installation

To run these projects, you need to have Python 3 and OpenCV installed on your machine. You can install them using pip:
pip install python pip install opencv-python

You also need to clone this repository or download the zip file:
git clone https://github.com/Ammar2k/cv-projects.git
