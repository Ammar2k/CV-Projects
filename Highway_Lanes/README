# Highway Lane Detection Project

The Highway Lane Detection Project is an algorithm-based solution that detects and highlights driving lanes in a video. By utilizing computer vision techniques, including edge detection and the Hough Transform, this project provides a visual representation of the lanes, aiding in navigation and enhancing driver safety. The algorithm, implemented using OpenCV and Python, can be integrated into autonomous driving systems, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and other applications focused on improving road safety and navigation.
